PTGen
=====
A Procedural Texture generator in java, using [lwjgl](http://lwjgl.org/) for display. The goal is to have a few basic equations to play around with, to configure the texture generation.

It is coded in Eclipse, and compiled on Windows. The lwjgl native files for Windows are copied in. To compile on GNU/Linux or Mac, you will need to copy the natives from the lwjgl install.
